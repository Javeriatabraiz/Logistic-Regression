# Logistic-Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement logistic regression for binary classification tasks. The notebook guides you through the full machine learning workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

**Overview**

The project focuses on using logistic regression to predict outcomes based on input features. It includes:

**Data preparation and exploratory data analysis.
Implementation of the logistic regression model.
Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
Visualization of the decision boundary and performance metrics.
This notebook is designed as a learning resource for those interested in understanding the fundamentals of logistic regression and its practical applications in binary classification problems.**

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib

**Usage**

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression.git
cd logistic-regression


**Install Dependencies:**

Use pip to install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:

**Open the LogisticRegression.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook:**

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook LogisticRegression.ipynb
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to follow along with the logistic regression implementation.

**Results**

Running the notebook will:

Provide an overview of the dataset and its features.
Show the training process of the logistic regression model.
Present evaluation metrics that indicate how well the model performs on the classification task.
Include visualizations to help interpret the model's decision boundary and performance.
